## 1. North star & launch-ready checklist

**Pre-launch. North star: shortest path to the FIRST PAYING COACH** (global-first: coach #1 is EN/USD — iyzico/TR explicitly NOT required for launch, per Decision log).

Launch-ready = every box checked:

- [x] Local main pushed to origin (2026-07-03, `d50fdc4`)
- [ ] Prod deployed to current main (RE-OPENED 2026-07-03 late: prod runs `e24fff4` magic-PIN deploy; one-step creation + subscription pricing `e24fff4..d50fdc4` pushed but NOT deployed. Bundle the `start_period` healthcheck fix with this deploy — celery needed manual start on both prior deploys)
- [ ] Post-deploy prod smoke: signup → provision → build site → create course by hand (pages/API/media/calendar smoked ✓; the interactive signup+builder walkthrough needs a real inbox — user)
- [ ] Coach subscribes on LIVE Stripe (one real Starter checkout with a real card, then refund) — platform billing verified in prod
- [ ] Student buys from a coach on LIVE Stripe Connect (real test purchase, then refund) — marketplace verified in prod
- [x] Media works in prod with path-style presigns (2026-07-03: signed Hetzner URL fetched 200)
- [ ] Failed-payment handling exists at MVP level (at minimum: past-due grace works, coach sees a "payment failed" state; full dunning UI can follow)
- [ ] Secrets rotated (`.env.prod` values exposed in a past session) — `BILLING_BYPASS_ENABLED=false` confirmed 2026-07-03; rotation itself still pending (owner)
- [ ] Onboarding walkthrough survives a non-technical dry run (someone who isn't you signs up and builds a page unaided)

## 2. Feature inventory

| Feature | Status | Evidence / note |
|---|---|---|
| Signup → tenant provisioning (magic link, questionnaire, templates, authenticated flow) | live-in-prod | deployed 2026-07-03 |
| Courses / downloads / media | live-in-prod | path-style presigns smoked in prod 2026-07-03; one-step create flow (course+curriculum, priced download) pushed `2cc2865`, built-not-deployed |
| Subscription pricing type ("included in subscription", courses+downloads) | built-not-deployed | pushed `d50fdc4`; any active sub unlocks, never sold one-off; +rich-text lessons, local lesson edit, video-picker modal; 4 tests, 2 tenant migrations |
| Billing plan source-of-truth cleanup | built-not-deployed | pushed `01ed71c`/`e2c4ac2`: PlatformSubscription is now the single source of a tenant's plan; superadmin plan change grants the subscription, not just the mirror — deploy alongside the mailbox batch |
| Live classes (GetStream), zoom classes, onsite events, calendar | live-in-prod | zoom_class fix verified in prod 2026-07-03 |
| Announcements (push/feed/email/templates/recurring) | live-in-prod | deployed 2026-06-23; coach-UI browser smoke still pending |
| Student PWA (installable, offline, web push) | live-in-prod | usage dashboards deployed 2026-07-03 |
| PWA login via emailed 6-digit code ("magic PIN") | live-in-prod | shipped 2026-07-03 (installed apps can't use link cookies); owner phone-test pending |
| Platform billing — subscribe/checkout (Stripe) | built-unverified | e2e-verified in TEST mode locally; never exercised on live keys in prod |
| Platform billing — quota enforcement (402s) | missing | quotas.py log-only; "Phase 3" handler not written |
| Platform billing — dunning/lifecycle UI, receipts, metrics | partial | webhook already maps `invoice.payment_failed`→past_due (webhooks.py); coach tile renders past_due badge; provider `create_customer_portal_session` implemented but NO endpoint/UI (platform.py: "Phase 2"); receipts/metrics missing |
| Admin-managed plan pricing (superadmin) | live-in-prod | adminkit platform-plans CRUD + provision_stripe_price swap — roadmap §15 is stale here |
| Marketplace — Stripe Connect direct charges (coach = MoR) | built-unverified | e2e-verified TEST mode; prod live-mode unverified; "don't blind-deploy" note stands |
| Marketplace — iyzico (TR) | missing | declared provider choice only; NOT needed for coach #1 (global-first) |
| Coach earnings / payouts view | partial | earnings endpoint + Connect dashboard link; no in-app payout history |
| Website builder (6 pages, blocks, autosave) | live-in-prod | deployed 2026-07-03; coach walkthrough pending |
| Filters / tags | live-in-prod | deployed 2026-07-03 |
| Coach mailbox (inbox, compose, inbound via CF Email Worker) | built-not-deployed | Gmail-style inbox (folders/search/thread) + TipTap rich text + attachments both directions merged+pushed (`a24f1ff`, 2026-07-04); prod still needs deploy + MAILBOX_INBOUND_SECRET + Email Worker redeploy; inbound requires custom domain |
| Platform inbox address (`<x>@contentor.app` for paid coaches) | built-not-deployed | merged+pushed (`333ce24`, 2026-07-03); CF Email Routing + catch-all→worker wired live per memory, but the Django-side registry/gating is pushed-not-deployed |
| Custom-domain onboarder (Route53 + annual sub) | partial | Phase 1 backend only, behind bypass fakes; phases 2-4 + prod creds outstanding |
| Impersonation (superadmin→coach, coach→student) | live-in-prod | coach→student e2e-covered |
| Superadmin panel (revenue, webhook log, adminkit) | live-in-prod | |
| Local dev/e2e infra (MinIO, fakes, sink, Playwright suite) | done (dev-only) | make e2e 17p+3s; stripe specs 2p; backend 603/603 |
| Monitoring (prometheus/grafana compose profile) | verify | is the profile actually running on the home server? |

## 3. Backlog

### Now (ranked — the money path is the launch gate)

1. **Verify the money path on live Stripe** — one real platform subscription + one real Connect purchase (then refund both). Converts the two `built-unverified` rows to `live-in-prod`; THE gate to inviting a real coach. Needs the owner's card. *(effort: half a day incl. webhook config)*
2. **Rotate exposed prod secrets** — `.env.prod` values were exposed in a past session; new keys from each provider dashboard (owner), then redeploy env. *(effort: 1-2 hours)*
3. **Interactive prod walkthrough** — signup with a real inbox → provision → build a page → create a course, as a coach would. Completes the smoke checklist box. *(effort: 1 hour)*
4. **MVP failed-payment handling** — smaller than thought: webhook past_due mapping + past_due badge + provider portal method already exist; remaining work = one portal endpoint + a "payment failed, update your card" banner/CTA. *(effort: 0.5-1 day)*

### Next

- Quota enforcement 402s (Phase 3) — needed before coaches can hit plan limits meaningfully; pair with plan-limit copy in the coach UI.
- Non-technical onboarding dry run + fixes (the `/courses`-empty-catalog class of bug is what a real coach hits) — recruit one non-technical tester.
- Announcements coach-UI browser smoke (10 minutes, has been pending since June).
- Coach payout history in-app (beyond the Connect dashboard link).
- Platform mailbox address for PAID coaches (decision 2026-07-03) — coach picks `<x>@contentor.app`; all mail to it lands in the in-app inbox; address doubles as the site's public contact email. Pieces: public-schema address registry (unique local part, reserved list, plan-gated via adminkit flag); inbound webhook resolves registry addresses alongside custom domains; sending_identity paid tier (send-from or Reply-To the chosen address); contact-form block routes into the mailbox instead of the coach's personal email; CF apex catch-all worker (custom addresses take precedence — verify); upsell banner copy splits (free→upgrade plan; paid-no-domain→brand it). Open: address lifecycle on downgrade/cancel (must be revocable; local-part squatting guardrails). Prod still needs MAILBOX_INBOUND_SECRET + worker deploy. *(effort: 2-3 days)*
- Monitoring check: confirm prometheus/grafana actually run on the home server; add a basic uptime alert.
- Deploy healthcheck permanent fix — django HAS `start_period: 60s` in `docker-compose.prod.yml` (verified at HEAD and at deployed `e24fff4`), but entrypoint demo-seed exceeds 60s so celery (`depends_on: service_healthy`) never starts → manual start on BOTH 2026-07-03 deploys. Lengthen `start_period` (e.g. 180s) or skip reseed when unchanged. *(effort: 30 min, verify on next deploy)*

### Later

- Custom-domain onboarder phases 2-4 (buy-domain UX, billing, provisioning polish).
- iyzico TR marketplace (when a TR coach matters commercially).
- Dunning/receipts/metrics (billing Phase 4) beyond the MVP.
- Superadmin→coach impersonation e2e spec; minio image pin; e2e cosmetic carries (list in `.superpowers/sdd/progress.md`).
- Weekly scheduled `/po review` automation (explicitly deferred at design time).

## 4. Decision log (append-only)

- 2026-06 (REFERENCE §15/16): near-term = finish platform billing + M2 marketplace; global-first (EN/USD leads, TR follows); coach = merchant of record (Connect Express, direct charges); Free coaches can never get paid; fees Starter 5% / Pro 4%; platform keeps fee on refund; sibling-site migration and go-live push explicitly out.
- 2026-07-02: payments philosophy for dev/e2e = real Stripe TEST mode (user choice); bypass remains available via env flip.
- 2026-07-03: PO advisor scoped to Contentor only; lens = everything ship-first; stage = pre-launch, north star = first paying coach; weekly scheduled review deferred.
- 2026-07-03 (audit): admin-managed pricing recognized as already built (roadmap §15 stale); iyzico confirmed not launch-blocking.
- 2026-07-03: mailbox positioning — receiving email is a PLAN feature; custom domain is branding on top. Paid coach picks a platform address `<x>@contentor.app` (coach-chosen local part, platform-wide unique, reserved list); ALL mail to it lands in the in-app inbox; the same address is the tenant site's public contact email, and the site contact form routes into the inbox instead of the coach's personal signup email. Free coaches stay send-only.

## 5. Audit stamp

Last check: **2026-07-04 (/po next)** — verified: HEAD = `a24f1ff`, **main == origin/main (clean tree, 0 ahead/0 behind)** — everything is now pushed. **20 commits landed since the last stamp** (`2cc2865..a24f1ff`), all merged to main: subscription pricing (`d50fdc4`), platform inbox address for paid coaches (`333ce24`), two billing source-of-truth fixes (`e2c4ac2`/`01ed71c` — PlatformSubscription is now the single plan authority), and the full Gmail-style inbox upgrade (`a24f1ff` — folders/search/thread, TipTap rich text, attachments both ways). Corrections this run: coach-mailbox row partial→built-not-deployed (inbox upgrade is merged+pushed, not just unmerged as memory said); added platform-inbox-address and billing-source-of-truth rows. `.env.prod` `BILLING_BYPASS_ENABLED=false` confirmed. **Prod deploy is now BEHIND by ~20 commits** and no version endpoint exists to auto-confirm (trusting ledger: prod ≈ `e24fff4`). Money-path gate UNCHANGED (both Stripe rows still `built-unverified` — never run on live keys). The deploy-vs-money ordering is now the live question (see Now #1/#2). NOTE: repo lives at `~/ws/projects-active/home-server/contentor` (the `projects-stopped-progress/Contentor` copy is a dead 2025 fork — ignore it).

Earlier — Update: **2026-07-03 (post-push correction)** — the "pricing_type WIP uncommitted / do NOT deploy" warning below is CLEARED: that work was committed and pushed as `d50fdc4` (subscription pricing + rich course-form editing; migrations 0014/0006 now tracked; full suites green: backend 634, e2e 21p+3s). Working tree is clean except this doc. Deploy is unblocked; prod remains at `e24fff4`.

Last check: **2026-07-03 (latest, /po next)** — verified: main == origin/main at `2cc2865`; prod `/api/health/` ok (db+redis ok); prod still at `e24fff4` per ledger (one-step creation NOT deployed → box stays open). WORKING-TREE WARNING STILL STANDS: other agent's pricing_type WIP uncommitted (access.py, courses/downloads models+views+tests, 2 UNTRACKED migrations 0014/0006) — do NOT `deploy.sh contentor` until landed or stashed. Corrections this run: (1) healthcheck claim fixed — django HAS `start_period: 60s`, demo-seed just exceeds it; (2) dunning row missing→partial — `invoice.payment_failed`→past_due webhook mapping, past_due coach badge, and provider portal method all exist; only endpoint+CTA UI missing (Now #4 effort cut to 0.5-1 day). Money-path rows unchanged (built-unverified). Earlier audit stamps below.

Last full audit: **2026-07-03** (post-deploy update: main PUSHED `1eb12a6`; prod DEPLOYED + smoked — pages 200, calendar zoom_class fix live, path-style media 200, tenant mailbox tables present, all containers healthy after manual celery start; deploy gotcha: entrypoint demo-seed exceeds healthcheck window) — earlier checks: git (unpushed count, branch list), prod `/api/health/` (ok), iyzico provider stub, quotas.py 402 status, dunning absence, adminkit plan CRUD, e2e/backend suite states, session ledger, memory (deploy dates, mailbox/domain/announcement pending items, secret rotations). Open `verify` items: monitoring profile on home server. (Tenant-migration entrypoint fix confirmed committed: `973d0cf`, `entrypoint.sh` runs `migrate_schemas --tenant`.)
